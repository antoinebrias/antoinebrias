## üß™ Research (Code of my scientific papers)
- **[Empirical dynamic programming (EDP)](https://github.com/antoinebrias/EDP2)**  
  A research paper with Steve Munch focused on the development of EDP framework.  
  Features:  
  -  a non-parametric model for the dynamics is estimated from time series data using Gaussian process-based dynamic modeling 
  -  a policy is then derived from the inferred dynamics using a temporal difference learning algorithm (MATLAB)

- **[Model-free ecosystem based management using EDP](https://github.com/antoinebrias/EDP2)**  
  A research paper with Steve Munch focused on performance of EDP in ecosystem management.  
  Features:  
  - MATLAB implementation of EDP aglorithm.  
  - Violin plot of the simulation results

## :fish: Fishery Science
- **[pfisheries](https://github.com/antoinebrias/pfisheries)**  
 Conversion of the original R project rfisheries by Karthik Ram, Carl Boettiger and Andrew Dyck 
  Features:  
  - Programmatic access to the Open Fisheries API  

- **[Asking FishBase](https://github.com/antoinebrias/askingfishbase)**  
  A Flask app to summarize data from FishFase using an LLM   
  Features:  
  - A LLM-based summary of info from Fishbase

- **[Fish Focused Chatbot](https://github.com/antoinebrias/chatbot_whaly)**  
  This web application is designed to provide information about fish species and their distribution. The chatbot utilizes an OpenAI language model to answer user queries and generate distribution maps for various fish species 
  Features:  
  - Conversational Interface: Ask questions about fish and receive informative responses.   
  - Taxon Identification: The chatbot identifies and provides information on specific fish taxa
  - Distribution Mapping: Generates maps showing the distribution of fish species based on user queries using GBIF API.
  - Follow-Up Suggestions: Offers suggestions for continuing the conversation based on user input

  A collection of detailed Jupyter notebooks highlighting my work on data science competitions and projects.  
  Features:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for various datasets.  
  - Machine learning models, visualizations, and optimization techniques.  

- **[AIS classification](https://github.com/antoinebrias/AIS_classification)**  
  Python script for classifying vesselcategories based on their trajectory.
  Features:  
  - Streamlit app
  - CNN training

 - **[Coalition Simulator](https://github.com/antoinebrias/coalition)**  
  A web application to explore coalition possibilities after the 2024 French legislative elections.  
  Features:  
  - Simulate coalition dynamics based on various criteria (number of parties, seats, political distance).  
  - Visualize the impact of coalitions on governance composition.  
  - Built with Python, Flask, and interactive visualizations.  

- **[Cockle Trees](https://github.com/antoinebrias/cockle_trees)**  
  A research project focused on modeling ecological dynamics, particularly within cockle populations.  
  Features:  
  - Simulations for environmental impact studies.  
  - Tools to analyze population changes over time.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Dataviz
- **[Sankey Diagram Code Generator](https://github.com/antoinebrias/sankey_formatter)**  
  Python script generating code snippets for creating Sankey diagrams in different formats  
  Using:  
  - SankeyMATIC: A web-based tool for creating Sankey diagrams.  
  - Plotly (Python): An interactive plotting library for Python.
  - networkD3 (R): An R package for interactive network diagrams.
